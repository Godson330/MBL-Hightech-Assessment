This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This project encompasses multiple testing strategies across different components and functionalities.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\  

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\  

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\  

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.

## File Descriptions

### `src/index.js`

This is the entry point of the React application. It renders the `App` component into the DOM.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css'; // Import global styles
import App from './App'; // Import the main App component

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
src/App.js

The main component that serves as the root of the application. It imports and renders the NamePasswordForm component.

javascript

Copy code

import React from 'react';

import NamePasswordForm from './NamePasswordForm'; // Import the form component

import './App.css'; // Import component-specific styles


function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Welcome to My React App</h1>
      <NamePasswordForm /> {/* Render the NamePasswordForm component */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
src/App.css
This file contains the styles for the App component. It is used to style the layout and appearance of the main application.

css
Copy code
.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.App-logo {
  height: 40vmin;
  pointer-events: none;
}

.App-header {
  background-color: #282c34;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);
  color: white;
}

.App-link {
  color: #61dafb;
}
